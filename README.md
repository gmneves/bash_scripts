# My Bash scripts
Here is some of my Bash script creations

## Inverted Range
This script was made to solve one need that I have.\
Based on a list of numbers it creates an inverted list of ranges.

Example:\

>**List**
>- 1
>- 2
>- 5
>- 8
>- 15
>- 20
>
>**Inverted Range, from 1 to 20**
>- 3-4
>- 6-7
>- 9-14
>- 16-19
